## Stable Isotope Mass Spectrometry Analysis Tool

Developed during my junior year at the University of Maryland, College Park while I was working at the department of Animal and Avian Sciences at the lab of Dr. Nishanth Sunny. This toolkit serves to read output data from an older version of Agilent's MassHunter Quantitative Analysis software to produce an organized output file.

My data analysis tool is used for some of the data in our publication [Branched-chain amino acids alter cellular redox to induce lipid oxidation and reduce de novo lipogenesis in the liver](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00307.2022).

Admittedly many of the features in this tool may be better in pandas, but this project was developed before I learned how to use python.
